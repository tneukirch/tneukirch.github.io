<h1> Postgraduate Teaching</h1>
From September to December 1998, I have given an informal lecture
course with the title <i>Introduction to the Theory of MHD Equilibria</i>.<br>
The main intention of the course was to give my own PhD students a
thorough introduction into the topic, but the course was open <br>
to everyone who wanted to attend.
<p>A typed version of the<a href="mhdlect.pdf"> lecture notes</a> (PDF
file) can be downloaded. <br>
</p>
<p>This version is far from perfect and 
any suggestions for corrections and improvement are welcome. </p>
