<li><b>  
Modelling Solar Magnetic Fields With 3D Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria
</b><p>
Static solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are often used to model solar magnetic fields in 
a relatively simple way, for example to interpret observational data or as a starting point for theoretical
investigations.



<li><b>  
Equilibrium and Dynamics of Collisionless Current Sheets
</b><p>
Current sheets are localised magnetic structures in plasmas with an increased electric current density. 
Current sheets are often crucial for the release of stored magnetic energy and thus they are
at the heart of a large number of interesting dynamical phenomena, e.g. solar activity and magnetospheric substorms.
In many space plasma systems particle-particle collisions are negligible and therefore the current 
sheets in such systems are called collisionless. <br>

Collisionless current sheet equilibria are useful for modelling purposes and as initial conditions for
theoretical investigations of dynamic physical processes like magnetic reconnection. Collisionless
plasmas can be described theoretically using Vlasov-Maxwell theory. <br>

Building on previous work by me and my co-workers (see e.g. publication No 84 in the 
<a href="http://www-solar.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~thomas/publist/publist.html">publication list</a>)
in this project novel aspects of the equilibrium and dynamics of collisionless current sheets will be investigated, using
a combination of analytical and numerical methods.
