<p>My main research interest is the application of theoretical plasma
physics methods to space and astrophysical plasma systems. This
includes planetary magnetospheres, the solar atmosphere, magnetospheres
of stars and compact objects etc. I have also done work on structure
formation in galaxies and the interstellar medium.
</p>
<p>A large part of my work focuses on plasma equilibria and their
stability. I am especially interested in equilibrium sequences
depending on external control parameters, bifurcation properties of
plasma systems and other nonlinear aspects of equilibrium theory. This
is important because
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The stationary states indicate the possible <i>ground states</i>
of a system. </li>
  <li>Often space and astrophysical plasma systems exhibit periods of
slow quasi-static evolution (energy accumulation) ending in a violent
eruptive process (energy release); equilibrium sequences are very
helpful to model this type of behavior. </li>
  <li>In general, equilibrium diagrams together with suitable criteria
for stability can indicate when and how a plasma equilibrium looses its
stability and time-dependent behavior is to be expected </li>
</ul>
<p>
Both analytical and numerical methods are used to solve the plasma
equilibrium equations. This concept has been applied to systems like
current sheets,
rotating magnetospheres, solar magnetic arcades and galactic disks.
</p>
<p>As said above equilibrium theory represents a first step towards the
understanding
of activity processes. The activity itself has to be modelled
time-dependently. Usually this can only by done by the means of plasma
simulations. Sometimes, however, even in that case analytical methods
can be used. So far work has been done on interacting flux systems in
the solar
corona, the development of resistive instabilities in the ionosphere
and
on finding exact time-dependent solutions of the MHD equations.
